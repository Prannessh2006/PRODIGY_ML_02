# 🚳 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

**Prodigy Internship - ML Task 02**

A machine learning project that applies K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on their behavioral patterns and characteristics. This analysis helps identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

## 🎉 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the practical application of **unsupervised machine learning** through customer segmentation. Using K-Means clustering, I analyze a dataset of mall customers to identify patterns and group them into distinct segments based on:

- **Age**: Customer demographics
- **Annual Income**: Spending power indicator
- **Spending Score**: Behavioral metric based on shopping patterns

## 📚 Dataset

**File**: `Mall_Customers.csv`

- **Records**: Mall customer data
- **Features**: Customer ID, Age, Gender, Annual Income, Spending Score
- **Objective**: Identify customer segments for marketing optimization

## 🖣️ Implementation Details

### 📝 Key Techniques Used

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data loading and exploratory analysis
   - Feature selection and normalization
   - Handling missing values

2. **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**
   - Determining optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method
   - Cluster formation and centroid calculation
   - Customer assignment to clusters

3. **Visualization & Analysis**
   - Cluster visualization using 2D/3D plots
   - Cluster characteristics analysis
   - Business insights extraction

### 🦀 Technologies & Libraries

```
- Python 3.x
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- NumPy (numerical computations)
- Scikit-learn (ML algorithms)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Execution
